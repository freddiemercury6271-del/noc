## 1. The Problem

Deepfake video, cloned audio, and fabricated PDF notices are now indistinguishable from
real ones by the human eye. An attacker with a laptop can forge a minister's circular, an
institution's emergency alert, or an official video memo — and it spreads faster than any
fact-check can debunk it. Institutions have **no way to cryptographically attest** their
content, and the public has **no way to verify** it without trusting a single central
server (which itself is a single point of attack).

No Cap turns "official-ness" into a **verifiable mathematical fact**:

- **Institutional authorities** sign their content with a private key that never leaves the
  server vault, while the signature is **anchored** in a ledger, on a blockchain, and on IPFS.
- **The public** pastes a file or text and instantly gets an **AUTHENTIC / PROVEN_FAKE /
  REVOKED / UNSIGNED** forensic verdict — nothing to install, no central server to trust alone.

---

## 2. Why No Cap Wins

| Threat / Limitation | Typical "solution" | Why No Cap beats it |
|---|---|---|
| **Central DB verification** | Verify against one server's database | Ours is **triple-anchored**: Postgres ledger + EVM L2 Merkle root + IPFS CID. Tampering with the DB is detectable against the on-chain root; the DB cannot be silently rewritten. |
| **Private key on the device** | Sign in the browser (key stored client-side, exportable, stealable) | Keys are **minted server-side in an isolated KMS vault**, encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM (HKDF per-owner), decrypted only inside a signing request. The browser **never sees the private key**. |
| **Signature ≠ protected content** | Sign a file's bytes once | We **bury forensic traps inside the media container itself** (MP3 `TXXX` frames, MP4 `©cmt` atom, PDF dictionary keys). Anyone who alters one frame trips the trap with zero doubt. |
| **"Verified by publisher" claims** | A logo/badge on a website (easy to copy) | Verification is **cryptographic and public**: anyone, anywhere, can run the same check. No gatekeeper. |
| **Impersonation** | Signers type their own title/institution | The post & institution embedded in every signature are **assigned only by a super admin** from the identity row. A signer cannot claim a fake title. Signing is blocked until the role is approved. |
| **Stolen/compromised keys** | Nothing to do, or slow manual revoke | **5-digit PIN kill-switch**: an authority revokes its own key in one click (double-warning modal); revocation **cascades to every block** signed by that key, and the whole network sees `REVOKED` immediately. |
| **Deepfake media on the internet** | AI detection models (false positives, always beatable) | Detection is not prediction — we do **cryptographic attribution of the original**. If a deepfake re-encodes the video, the forensic traps it re-encodes along are mathematically marked as tampered. |
| **Privacy** | Pin the whole media file to IPFS | **ZK-style receipt anchoring**: only a JSON digest/signature/CID leaves the network — never raw media. |
| **Back-of-the-envelope "verify"** | Download the whole video | Verify by **hash, text, receipt JSON, or file** — the receipt lets you prove authenticity of a broadcast with a few hundred bytes. |

**In short:** No Cap combines *media forensics* (traps), *cryptographic identity* (KMS
vault), *immutability* (Merkle + EVM L2 + IPFS), and *public verifiability* (open endpoint)
into one pipeline that no single layer alone provides.

## 3. The Pitch

### 30-second version

> "Deepfakes destroy trust in official media. Every solution today either trusts a single
> server or hands the private key to a browser. No Cap makes official-ness a
> **mathematical fact**: an institution's signature is generated in a server-side KMS vault,
> the signature is **buried as a forensic trap inside the actual audio/video/PDF**, and the
> digest is anchored simultaneously in a **Postgres ledger, a Merkle root on an EVM
> Layer-2 chain, and an IPFS receipt**. The public then drops any file into our verifier and
> gets an instant, tamper-evident verdict: **AUTHENTIC, PROVEN_FAKE, REVOKED, or
> UNSIGNED**. No AI guessing, no install, no single point of trust."

### 3-minute version

1. **The attack** — cloned voice, deepfake video, fabricated PDF. In minutes it outruns
   fact-checkers. Authorities need an *attestation* layer, and the public needs a *check*.
2. **Signing** — an authority logs in with Google OAuth; No Cap mints a SECP256R1 key pair
   inside the server, encrypts the private key with AES-256-GCM under a per-owner HKDF key.
   The signer can only sign with a **post & institution approved by a super admin** — no
   self-claiming. We hash the file, ECDSA-sign it, and write the signature *into the file's
   own metadata* (ID3 `TXXX` for MP3/WAV, `©cmt` for MP4/MOV, dictionary keys for PDF).
3. **Anchoring** — the final hash becomes a ledger block; a JSON receipt (digest +
   signature + issuer + time, **no media**) is pinned to IPFS; and the block hashes are
   batched into a **balanced Merkle tree** whose root is broadcast on-chain in tx data
   `NOCAP_ROOT:<root>`.
4. **Verifying** — anyone drops the file/text/receipt into the public verifier. The server
   recomputes the hash, checks the ledger, validates the signature, then runs the forensic
   trap check. Four clean verdicts come out, plus the signer's *name, post, institution*
   (never bare email) and the Web3 transaction link.
5. **Kill-switch** — a compromised authority self-revokes with a 5-digit PIN; every block
   they ever signed flips to `REVOKED`, and the network reflects it instantly.

## 4. Architecture & Data Flow

```
 [ Institutional Authority ]
    ├─ Multimedia Signing        (PDF / MP3 / WAV / MP4 / MOV)
    │    └─ Metadata Trap Injection   (ID3 TXXX / MP4 ©cmt / PDF /Nocap_* keys)
    └─ Emergency Broadcast       (raw string → SHA-256 → JSON receipt)
          └─ Isolated KMS Vault       (SECP256R1 ECDSA, AES-256-GCM at rest, HKDF per owner)
               └─ ECDSA signature `hybrid:<sighex>`
                    ├─ ZK-IPFS Anchoring   (receipt JSON only — never raw media; Pinata)
                    ├─ Neon PostgreSQL Ledger (blocks + signer identity state)
                    └─ Merkle Tree Batch → EVM L2 tx  (data: NOCAP_ROOT:<merkle_root>)

 [ Public Verification ]
    file | hash | text | receipt JSON
        → SHA-256 → ledger lookup → ECDSA verify → forensic trap check
        → VERDICT: AUTHENTIC | PROVEN_FAKE | REVOKED | UNSIGNED
```

Data flow during a single signing event (see `app.py` /api/sign):

1. `raw` bytes read → `raw_hash = SHA-256(raw)`.
2. Vault decrypts the owner's private key → signs `raw_hash` → `sig_hex = hybrid:<r,s>`.
3. `inject_media_trap()` writes the issuer/signature/time **into the container** →
   `trapped_payload`.
4. `final_hash = SHA-256(trapped_payload)` → the *tamper-evident* identity because any
   re-encode changes the bytes **and** wounds the trap.
5. ZK receipt pinned to IPFS (metadata only) + `LedgerBlock` row committed.
6. On `POST /api/blockchain/sync`, un-anchored hashes form a Merkle tree whose root is
   broadcast on-chain (`data = NOCAP_ROOT:<root>`).

## 5. Code Walkthrough — app.py (Backend)

Single FastAPI file, organized into **8 numbered "columns"** (sections) with clear comment
headers, so it doubles as a readable specification. 936 lines.

### Column 1 — Environment & DB Config (top of file)

**`load_dotenv()`** — loads `.env` (gitignored) so secrets never live in source.
- `DATABASE_URL` — required; SQLAlchemy engine. `connect_args={"check_same_thread":False}`
  is set only for SQLite so SQLAlchemy doesn't refuse file DBs in dev; ignored for Postgres.
- `MASTER_VAULT_KEY` — required, padded to 32 bytes. This is the **root of the key hierarchy**
  — *why?* AES-GCM wants a fixed-length key; we normalize so any 32+ byte passphrase works.
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` — required for issuing identities.
- `WEB3_RPC_URL`, `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`, `PINATA_JWT` — **optional**. When blank, the engine
  runs in *simulation mode* so the whole system is demo-able offline (simulated tx hashes and
  deterministic fake CIDs). This is intentional for a hackathon; see §13 for production notes.
- `SUPER_ADMINS` + `is_super_admin()` — an allow-list of emails with elevated power.
  *Why a list?* One user should not be able to assign themselves super-admin power; instead of
  a mutable "role" column, the list is part of the deployed configuration.

### Column 2 — Database Models & Migrations

- `SignerIdentity` — one per Google account. primary key `email`; stores the **public PEM**
  and the **encrypted private PEM** (`enc_priv_key`), plus `institution`/`designation`
  (role, set by super admin), revocation state, and the 5-digit `revoke_pin`.
- `LedgerBlock` — one per signed artifact. `file_hash` is `UNIQUE` (a tamper-evident ID,
  no double-signing), plus signer snapshot columns (name/institution/designation are
  *copied onto the block* so a later role change doesn't rewrite history), `sig_hex`,
  `ipfs_cid`, `tx_hash`, `merkle_root`, `is_revoked`.
- *Broadcast columns (NEW):* `notice_content` (the raw emergency text) and
  `notice_deleted` (retraction flag). These power the public notice board and the
  authority retraction flow (`/api/broadcasts`, `/api/broadcasts/delete`).
- `VerificationLog` — append-only log of every public verification verdict → powers the
  analytics dashboard.
- *Cleanup note:* a dead `BenchmarkLog` scaffold was removed during the refactor — keeping
  unused models only invites confusion and untested queries.
- `_MIGRATIONS` list runs idempotent `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` at startup —
  *why?* So an older deployed DB upgrades in place without wipe-and-reset, which is what a
  production roll-out needs. Each migration is wrapped in try/except so a missing table or
  already-applied column can't crash boot.

### Column 3 — Cryptography & KMS Vault

- `derive_owner_key(owner_email)` — **HKDF** with SHA-256: master key + salt
  (email, lowercased) + info `nischay-owner-vault-key-v1`. *Why HKDF?* Every owner gets a
  *distinct* key derived from the same master — one compromised identity key does not expose
  the others, and no key is reused across owners. Domain-separating with `info` prevents
  cross-protocol reuse.
- `encrypt_vault_key` / `decrypt_vault_key` — **AES-256-GCM**. Random 12-byte nonce is
  prepended to the ciphertext, so the stored blob is `nonce || ciphertext` base64-encoded.
  *Why GCM?* Authenticated encryption — tampering with the blob fails decryption loudly
  rather than decrypting garbage.
- `make_session_token(email)` / `get_current_admin(request)` — a stateless session token
  `email::HMAC(MASTER_VAULT_KEY, email)`. The FastAPI dependency `get_current_admin` rebuilds
  the expected HMAC and compares with `hmac.compare_digest` (constant-time, prevents timing
  attacks). *Why a signed cookie rather than a DB session?* Stateless — no session store to
  scale, no DB round-trip per request; revoking power is immediate because every query
  re-reads `SignerIdentity.is_revoked`. Used with `HttpOnly` (`same_site=lax`).
- `get_or_create_signer_identity` — on first Google login: generates `SECP256R1` key pair,
  stores public PEM in plaintext (safe, it's public), **stores only the encrypted private
  PEM**. This is the whole "browser never sees the key" guarantee.

### Column 4 — Deepfake Forensics & Web3 Anchoring

- `upload_receipt_to_ipfs(receipt_dict)` — pins a **JSON receipt only**. With no JWT it
  returns a deterministic simulated CID (`QmReceipt<SHA-256>`), preserving the data shape so
  the rest of the pipeline is unchanged. *Why ZK-style?* The media never leaves the local
  network; the 300-byte receipt is enough to prove the file existed at `timestamp` signed by
  `issuer`.
- `inject_media_trap(file_bytes, filename, signer_label, sig_hex, timestamp)` — the core
  forensic primitive:
  - **PDF** → pypdf rewrites pages and injects `/Nocap_Issuer`, `/Nocap_Signature`,
    `/Nocap_Timestamp` into the document Info dictionary.
  - **MP3/WAV** → mutagen `ID3` tags: `TXXX(desc="NOCAP_ISSUER")`, `TXXX(desc="NOCAP_SIG")`
    (UTF-8, `encoding=3`). If there is no existing ID3 header, it creates one
    (`ID3NoHeaderError` → `ID3()`).
  - **MP4/M4A/MOV** → the iTunes metadata `©cmt` (comment) atom is set to a stamped string
    `NOCAP_VERIFIED|ISSUER:SIG:TIME`.
  - *Why native containers, not sidecar files?* A `.sig` sidecar gets lost in forwarding;
    a trap *inside* the same file survives rehashing and reveals exactly that the file was
    re-encoded/tampered. Every branch is wrapped in try/except that **returns the untouched
    bytes** on failure — we never corrupt a file on a parsing edge case.
- `extract_media_trap(file_bytes, filename)` — the mirror check: does the container still
  carry a `NOCAP_*` / `/Nocap_*` field? Returns bool. This is the signal that distinguishes
  "UNSIGNED" (never signed) from "PROVEN_FAKE" (was signed, then altered).
- `compute_merkle_root(leaf_hashes)` — balanced binary Merkle; odd levels duplicate the last
  node; a pair is concatenated and SHA-256'd. Returns the root hex. Empty input → fixed
  `GENESIS` hash (deterministic, and avoids a degenerate empty root).
- `anchor_merkle_to_chain(merkle_root)` — Web3.py: builds a 0-value EIP-1559-compatible tx,
  sets `data = NOCAP_ROOT:<root>`, signs with the testnet wallet, broadcasts. Without RPC it
  returns a fake `0xSIMULATED_TX_<sha>` for demo parity. On failure returns `TX_FAILED` so
  the UI can surface it instead of silently lying.

### Column 5 — FastAPI Setup & Base Routes

- Security headers middleware: `nosniff`, `DENY` framing, `X-XSS-Protection`,
  HSTS — cheap hardening that a judge's security scan will notice.
- CORS locked to localhost origins with `allow_credentials=True` (session cookies).
- `GET /` and `GET /main.js` serve the static files (no CDN dependency for the app shell).
- `POST /api/admin/login` — verifies the **Google OAuth ID token** with
  `id_token.verify_oauth2_token` against `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` (the token is self-asserting so
  there is no server-to-server round trip), enforces `email_verified`, creates/mints the
  identity, then sets the HttpOnly signed session cookie. All wrapped so bad tokens return
  401 `AUTH FAILED`.
- `POST /api/admin/logout` — deletes the cookie.
- `GET /api/admin/me` — read-only role probe; returns `pending_approval` when a signer has
  no assigned designation/institution. *Why on `me`?* The UI needs it on every load to
  decide whether to enable the signing panel.
- `POST /api/admin/assign_role` — **the anti-impersonation guard**. Super admin only (403
  otherwise). Writes designation (≤150 chars) + institution onto the target identity's row.
  *Why here and not in signing?* Because the *signed artifact* carries the role, the role
  must be **administratively authoritative**. Signers physically cannot name their own title.

### Column 6 — Signing, Broadcasts & Verification Engine

- `POST /api/sign_text` — emergency alert path. A pure string (the broadcast) is hashed,
  signed, wrapped in a JSON receipt (`version: nocap-v2-emergency`, title, urgency, content,
  hash, signature, timestamp, signer block), pinned to IPFS, and returned as a download.
  The message text is also stored as `notice_content` so the public board can display it.
  Active notices re-sign as a **dedup no-op**; a notice the issuing authority retracted
  earlier **re-publishes for its original issuer** (only they — the pubkey embedded in the
  row is theirs — so a copycat re-issue is swallowed by the unique-hash guard instead of
  corrupting the row's signature).
  *Why a JSON receipt for text?* A text alert has no binary container to trap; the receipt
  itself is the verifiable artifact — you paste it into the verifier and prove origin.

### Emergency Notice Board (public feed + authority retraction)

- `GET /api/broadcasts` — **public, unauthenticated** feed of live emergency notices
  (newest first, `?limit=200` max). Each row exposes only bulletin-safe data: title, urgency
  (`EMERGENCY (X)` parsed), content, signer *name*, institution, post, timestamp, file hash,
  signature, IPFS CID. **No emails ever leak.** When a valid session cookie rides along, it
  additionally returns `is_mine` / `can_delete` per row so the UI can show authority
  controls without ever exposing signer emails to the public.
- `POST /api/broadcasts/delete` — retract a live notice (sets `notice_deleted=True`; the
  ledger row stays for tamper-evidence). A normal admin may only retract **their own**
  broadcasts (403 otherwise); a **super admin may retract any**. The original issuer
  reviving the exact text afterwards resurrects the notice on the board; anyone else's
  identical re-issue is a no-op. Verification still returns `AUTHENTIC` for a retracted
  notice but flags `retracted: true` ("notice retracted by issuing authority") — honest
  math, honest attribution.
- Client-side, the landing verify panel is a **two-column split**: integrity check on the
  left, a compact **auto-scrolling 24-hour notice rail** on the right that loops back-to-back
  (pauses on hover) and shows "No active broadcasts" when an authority hasn't signed in the
  last 24 hours. A **"Check previous broadcasts"** footer opens the *View All* modal with
  every past notice and clear `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC` timestamps.
- `POST /api/sign` — the media pipeline described in §4. Key subtleties:
  - Signs **both** the raw hash and the final trapped hash (`final_sig`) so verification of
    the *delivered* artifact is always possible.
  - Deduplicates with `insert_block_once` — a `UNIQUE(file_hash)` constraint backs it, so
    re-signing the same file is an atomic no-op (Postgres `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`; SQLite
    takes the simple existence-check path).
  - Single file → streams the signed binary directly; multiple → a ZIP (`signed_batch.zip`).
  - The signer's label is baked into the traps as `Name (Post, Institution)` — the role the
    super admin assigned, never user-supplied.
- `POST /api/verify` — the forensic decision engine (§8). Accepts *file*, *client_hash*,
  *raw_text*, or a *receipt JSON* (whose `file_hash` wins). Input is normalised by
  `resolve_verify_input()` (checks hex-shaped hashes, prefers the receipt's embedded hash),
  records every verdict to `VerificationLog`, and always returns a JSON verdict with hash,
  filename, signer snapshot, tx link. Orphaned/revoked signer keys resolve to `REVOKED`
  instead of crashing. **Note:** email is never returned — only name + post + institution
  (privacy-conscious public API).
- `POST /api/verify_chunk` + `POST /api/verify_complete` — **chunked verification** for
  files too large for Vercel's ~4.4MB per-request body cap. Public (verification is a public
  feature). Slices buffer in Postgres (3MB max each), then `verify_complete` reassembles and
  runs the *same* `_verify_bytes()` engine as `/api/verify`, so a 20MB+ media file verifies
  as a handful of under-cap requests instead of one 413.

### Column 7 — System Commands & Web3 Sync

- `POST /api/blockchain/sync` — finds blocks with `tx_hash IS NULL`, builds the Merkle root
  of their hashes, anchors it, stamps every block with the same root+tx. (One tx per batch =
  cheap gas, and the root covers the batch.)
- `POST /api/set_pin` — stores the 5-digit kill-switch PIN.
- `POST /api/revoke` — kill-switch: super admins can revoke anyone; normal signers can only
  revoke **themselves** (`target != admin → 403`) and must supply their 5-digit PIN. On
  revoke, `SignerIdentity.is_revoked=True` **and** a bulk UPDATE flips every
  `LedgerBlock.signer_email=` row to `is_revoked=True` — cascading revocation.
- `POST /api/reinstate` — super admin only; requires the victim's PIN (or the documented
  `00000` bypass) — *why?* reinstating should require knowing something only the creator or
  top admin knows, preventing accidental mass undo.
- `POST /api/dday` — super-admin *demo tool*: injects 5 "MALICIOUS ACTOR" blocks + 15 fake
  verdict logs so a judge can see PROVEN_FAKE analytics light up. Clearly a demo-only
  endpoint (see §13).
- `POST /api/rollback` — super-admin ledger rollback to a timestamp; *why?* demonstrates
  disaster recovery for an incident (editing history), which the immutable on-chain root
  makes detectable if abused — good talking point for a judge.

### Column 8 — Dashboards & Telemetry

- `GET /api/ledger` — scoped by privilege: a normal signer sees **only their own**
  signers/blocks; a super admin sees everything plus `registered_at`/`revoked_at`
  (the "key issuance ledger" requirement). Also derives `crypto_mode` and `is_compromised`
  from the `hybrid:` sig prefix.
- `GET /api/analytics` — totals per verdict across `VerificationLog`.
- `GET /api/network` — Vis.js graph payload (nodes = authorities + files, edges = who signed
  what), also privilege-scoped.
- `GET /api/stats` — **aggregate, auth-free** counters (`signed_docs`, `trusted_issuers`)
  so the landing hero can show live network numbers without leaking any PII.

---

## 6. Code Walkthrough — index.html (UI)

Single self-contained page (no build step) — loads Google GSI, Chart.js, Vis.js, JSZip from
CDN. All styling is in one `<style>` block with CSS variables for a consistent design system.

### Design tokens (the `:root` block)

`--bg-0: #05070c`, glass cards (`--card-bg`, `--card-border`), accent palette
(violet `#8b5cf6`, indigo `#6366f1`, cyan `#06d5fa`, emerald `#22e3a4`, rose `#fb3a6b`,
amber `#ffb84c`), and readable text steps `--text-hi/md/lo`. *Why variables?* One-line
rebrand; all state colors (auth=emerald, fake=rose, rev=amber, uns=gray) map to these tokens.

### Layout views (`.view` sections, toggled by nav)

1. **Hero / landing** (`view-home`)
   - Live status badge (pulsing dot), gradient headline, subtitle.
   - Two stat cards: **Documents Signed** and **Trusted Issuers**, driven by `data-counter`
     attributes that `main.js` animates — now **live** from `GET /api/stats` when available,
     falling back to demo numbers offline.
   - Primary CTA buttons and a public-verification dropzone.
2. **Verify view** — a **two-column split**: the integrity check (toggle `file | text`,
   drag-and-drop zone, results container) on the left, and the compact **Official Notices**
   rail on the right — an auto-scrolling ticker of every emergency broadcast signed in the
   last 24h (pauses on hover), a "No active broadcasts" empty state, and a
   "Check previous broadcasts →" footer that opens the **View All** modal
   (`viewAllModal`) with the full history and clear UTC timestamps.
3. **Admin view** (`view-admin`)
   - Non-authed state shows an isolated **admin-login-screen** (Google button).
   - Authed state shows: signer **role badge** (pending-approval → amber, disables signing),
     media signing dropzone, emergency broadcast composer, super-admin **role assignment**
     panel (`roleTarget`, `roleDesignation`, `roleInstitution`), PIN-setup fields, revoke
     buttons per authority, dependency-map toggle, and the ledger table.
4. **Analytics view** — four KPI tiles + a Chart.js "Threat Distribution" bar chart with a
   scope selector (session / local history / global network).

### Modals & chrome

- `revokeModal` — PIN entry flow that swaps between *setup* (first revoke) and *verify*
  (subsequent) screens, plus a **double-warning** for non-super-admins (they cannot undo
  themselves).
- `userUnrevokeModal` — explains the 24-hour un-revoke support channel for normal signers.
- Toast stack (`toastWrap`), footer status bar, and the panel spotlight hover effect
  (`--mx/--my` mouse tracking on `.glass-panel`).

## 7. Code Walkthrough — main.js (Client Engine)

The page runs in an IIFE for encapsulation; browser-facing handlers are exported on
`window` because the HTML uses inline `onclick`. 1302 lines.

| Module / function | What it does & why it's built this way |
|---|---|
| `safeFetch` | Wraps `fetch(credentials:include)`, JSON-parses errors, returns a normalized `{ok,data,error}` so the rest of the file never repeats try/catch. |
| `recordMetric` | Tags each verdict into **session memory** + `localStorage` ("local history") so the analytics scope switcher works fully client-side for the public. |
| `animateCounter` + `fetchPublicStats` | Eases hero numbers to their target (cubic ease-out); refreshes from `/api/stats` to show live counts. |
| `window.toast` + `icons` | Tiny non-blocking notification system (3.2 s auto-dismiss). |
| `esc`, `shortHash`, `copyHash` | Output-escaping (`&<>"'`) so server data can never inject HTML; truncated hash display with copy-to-clipboard. |
| View switching | Nav buttons hide/show `.view` sections and lazily invoke `fetchLedger`/`loadAnalytics` only when their view opens. |
| `window.switchVerifyMode` | Toggles file-vs-text containers and the toggle button active state. |
| `checkAuthStatus` | Calls `/api/admin/me`; flips admin-login vs dashboard; stores role/pending/super flags; returns only aggregated state. |
| `renderSignerRoleBadge` | Shows post/institution badge; **disables the sign button** while `pending_approval` (with an amber "approval pending" hint). |
| `window.handleGoogleLogin` | Calls Google `gsi` `CredentialResponse`, posts `credential` to `/api/admin/login`, re-checks auth. |
| Verify flow (`handleVerify` → `renderVerificationRow`) | Client hashes the local file (JSZip path for `.json` receipts), builds FormData, POSTs `/api/verify`, then renders the verdict card: **colored banner** (`auth/fake/rev/uns`), actionable note, and a `meta-grid` (file, truncated SHA-256 with copy, signer name + role tag, Web3 tx link with `L2 ANCHOR` chip), plus an inline media player with a red/green border matching the verdict. |
| Sign media (`handleSignMedia`) | Guards role approval, shows spinner, POSTs `files[]`, triggers a download of the trapped binary/ZIP, refreshes ledger. |
| Broadcast (`handleBroadcastNotice`) | Same guard, posts `title/urgency/message` to `/api/sign_text`, downloads the JSON receipt. |
| `applyFilters` / `fetchLedger` | Populates the ledger table (sticky header, zebra rows, signer role tags, Web3 tx/status pills) for the currently-scoped signer set; renders the Vis.js dependency map on demand. |
| Notice board (`loadBroadcasts` + `renderNoticeFeed` + `noticeFeedItem`) | Fetches `GET /api/broadcasts?limit=200`; filters to **last 24h** (`parseBroadcastDate` → UTC epoch), duplicates the list and animates a seamless CSS ticker (pauses on hover; static below 3 items); shows "No active broadcasts" otherwise. Count chip = `active · total`. |
| `window.viewAllBroadcasts` / `closeViewAll` | Opens the View-All modal with the complete broadcast history (backdrop-click closes). |
| `window.verifyBroadcast` | Loads the exact signed text into the public Verifier (text mode) and scrolls to it — closing the SEE → PROVE loop; legacy "message on file" rows fall back to copying the hash. |
| `window.deleteBroadcast` / `renderBroadcastManager` | Confirm → `POST /api/broadcasts/delete` → toast → refresh. The admin Emergency panel lists retractable notices (mine only, or everyone's for super admins) with explicit timestamps. |
| `handleAssignRole` | Posts the super-admin assignment form to `/api/admin/assign_role`. |
| Revoke flow | `checkPinInput` (numeric 5 only) → modal `openModal` distinguishes **setup** vs **verify** → `showDoubleWarning` for non-super-admins → `executeApiCall` posts `/api/revoke` (with PIN) or `/api/reinstate`. |
| `executeDDay` / `executeRollback` / `syncToBlockchain` | Super-admin command buttons for the demo (inject fake attack, rollback to timestamp, batch-anchor to L2). |
| `toggleLedgerView` / `loadNetworkGraph` | Swaps the ledger table ↔ Vis.js network graph (authority ⇄ file nodes, red = compromised/revoked). |
| `loadAnalytics` / `renderThreatChart` | Merges session/local/global data and draws the Chart.js bar chart (guard: canvas may not exist yet — the charter only renders if `threatCanvas` is found). |
| Init | Hover spotlight on `.glass-panel`, `checkAuthStatus()`, `fetchPublicStats()`, welcome toast. |

## 8. The Verification Decision Matrix

The order of checks in `/api/verify` is deliberate (cheapest first, then strongest):

1. **Not in ledger, no trap** → `UNSIGNED` (unverified/un-official).
2. **Not in ledger, trap present** → `PROVEN_FAKE` — *a trap can only exist if the file was
   signed by us; if our recorded hash doesn't match, the bytes were changed → deepfake.*
3. **In ledger, signer or block revoked** → `REVOKED` — signature math is fine but the
   issuing authority has been killed.
4. **In ledger, signature verifies against the on-chain-anchored public key** → `AUTHENTIC`.
5. **In ledger, signature does not verify** → `PROVEN_FAKE` (binary altered after signing).

| Verdict | Forensic condition | UI |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTHENTIC` | Hash matches ledger + ECDSA valid + identity active | Green banner + green-bordered player |
| `PROVEN_FAKE` | Trap present but hash/signature mismatch (content altered) | Red "FORGERY DETECTED" banner + red-bordered player |
| `REVOKED` | Hash + signature valid but key killed | Amber "SIGNER KEY WITHDRAWN" banner |
| `UNSIGNED` | No ledger match and no trap | Gray "NOT FOUND IN LEDGER" banner |

---

## 9. Security Model & Design Decisions

- **Keys never in the browser.** ECDSA private keys are minted server-side, stored
  AES-256-GCM encrypted, decrypted only inside signing. Even a stolen session cookie can't
  extract a key (there is no "export key" route).
- **Privilege separation.** `GET /api/ledger` and `/api/network` scope results to the
  requesting signer unless super-admin. Role assignment is super-admin-only. Revocation
  requires PIN (or the super-admin path). Registration dates are super-admin-only.
- **Tamper-evidence.** `file_hash` is UNIQUE and is what the Merkle tree + on-chain `data`
  field commit to. Editing the Postgres ledger silently produces a root mismatch vs the
  chain — the attack is provable.
- **De-prioritized identity leak.** Public verify responses omit emails entirely (name,
  post, institution only).
- **Anti-toxicity contracts.** Malformed containers return original bytes (trap helpers),
  non-existent canvas guarded, dup blocks skipped, string lengths capped at 150 for roles,
  demo endpoints gated to super admins.
- **Stateless sessions with constant-time MAC** and full bangs on startup when required
  env vars are missing (fail-fast, not fail-open).

## 11. Setup & Run

```bash
git clone <repo-url> && cd crypto
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate                 # Windows (Linux: source .venv/bin/activate)
pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env                # then fill real values
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

Open http://localhost:8000.

**Environment variables** (`.env`, gitignored):

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | yes | SQLAlchemy URL (Neon Postgres recommended) |
| `MASTER_VAULT_KEY` | yes | 32+ byte root KMS key. **Changing after identities exist = locks their vault keys.** |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | yes | Google OAuth 2.0 client (GSI + backend token verification) |
| `WEB3_RPC_URL` | no | EVM L2 RPC (blank → simulated tx) |
| `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` | no | L2 test wallet (blank → simulated tx) |
| `PINATA_JWT` | no | Pinata JWT (blank → simulated CIDs) |
| `BLOCKCHAIN_EXPLORER_URL` | no | Link base for tx hashes (default Polygon Amoy explorer) |
| `KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL` | no | Neon wake-up pinger interval in seconds (default 45; `0` disables). Auto-disabled on Vercel. |

### Deploying to Vercel

The repo ships with `api/index.py` (serverless entrypoint: `from app import app as app`)
and `vercel.json` (rewrites everything to that one function, `maxDuration: 30`). The app
serves its own `index.html` / `main.js` with `Cache-Control: no-store`, so there is **no
`public/` build step** — you deploy the source folder as-is.

1. Push to GitHub (or use the `vercel` CLI from this folder).
2. In the project's **Settings → Environment Variables**, set exactly what your local `.env`
   has — the app hard-fails without them:
   - `DATABASE_URL` (must reach Neon/Postgres from Vercel's IPs)
   - `MASTER_VAULT_KEY` (must be **byte-identical** to your local value, or existing
     identities' KMS keys become undecryptable)
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` (and `WEB3_RPC_URL`, `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`, `PINATA_JWT` optionally)
3. `VERCEL=1` is injected automatically by Vercel — the app then sets the session cookie
   `Secure` flag, disables the Neon keepalive thread, and skips nothing else.
4. Recommended: set the base domain's cookie realm to `SameSite=Lax` (default) and add a
   custom `BLOCKCHAIN_EXPLORER_URL` if you anchor on a different chain.
5. Cold starts: Neon + dependency import can take a few seconds on the first hit — the
   engine already retries DNS/connect 3× and treats the table bootstrap as best-effort.

## 12. Judge Q&A

**Q: What stops someone from forking the code and re-running it?**
A: Security isn't in the code alone — it's in the *anchored commitments*. Digests are bound
to an on-chain Merkle root and IPFS CIDs; a fork cannot re-anchor old records retroactively.
The KMS master key and super-admin allow-list are operational secrets (env), not source.

**Q: How is this better than an AI deepfake detector?**
A: Detectors *predict* probability and are beatable. We do *cryptographic attribution* —
the publisher proves they made it; any alteration breaks a signature and a forensic trap
with mathematical certainty. Detection complements, attribution decides.

**Q: But nothing in the browser can verify — don't you trust one server?**
A: The server is a *disputable witness*, not a trusted one: its ledger must match the
on-chain root and IPFS receipts that we did NOT create. A hostile server can't silently mint
or rewrite history without breaking those external commitments.

**Q: Why L2 and a Merkle batch instead of one tx per file?**
A: One cheap root-anchoring tx per batch covers thousands of documents (gas-efficient, and
proven via the stored `merkle_root` on every block). Individual files stay queryable through
the ledger + CID.

**Q: Cost / throughput?**
A: Signing is one ECDSA sign + metadata write (ms). IPFS pinning of a ~300-byte receipt is
near-free; a single L2 anchor covers a whole batch. This scales to institutional notice
volumes with commodity hardware.

**Q: What if Google is down / I have no internet?**
A: The signing math is local (fastapi + cryptography). Missing IPFS/Web3 simply degrades to
simulation mode with deterministic receipts — try it with a bare `DATABASE_URL` +
`MASTER_VAULT_KEY`.

**Q: Is the role system real?**
A: The post & institution inside each signature come exclusively from the identity row set by
`/api/admin/assign_role`. `/api/sign` does not accept them; pending signers get a 403 and an
amber badge. This directly addresses "officials can't pretend to be other officials."

## 13. Demo Shortcuts vs Production Checklist

**Deliberate demo shortcuts**
- Simulated IPFS (deterministic fake CID) / simulated chain tx when RPC or JWT envs are blank.
- Hardcoded `SUPER_ADMINS` allow-list in source.
- `/api/dday` attack-injection endpoint (nothing real to stop here).
- `rollback` deletes rows (real deployments would tombstone/append audit events).
- PIN stored as-is in the DB (demo clarity; production should store a PBKDF2/bcrypt hash).

**Before production**
1. Rotate `MASTER_VAULT_KEY` and re-mint identities (or persist a keystore offline).
2. Set `secure=True` on the session cookie behind HTTPS.
3. Replace PIN storage with a slow hash; add brute-force backoff.
4. Move `SUPER_ADMINS` into env/config management.
5. Pin real content to IPFS and fire real L2 testnet txs; keep `BLOCKCHAIN_EXPLORER_URL` aligned.
6. Rate-limit everything via slowapi (already in place), add an allow-list for `/api/assign_role`.
